                 BAL - a Bifurcation Analysis Library

		       	 Installation instructions


To install this library, you need the following libraries:
1) CVode, for the solution of ordinary differentail equations. It is 
available at 
2) HDF5, to save data in compressed H5 files. It is available at 
<http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>
3) boost, for the use of threads. It is available at <http://www.boost.org/>

The installation procedure is the usual one. Type:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

If CVode, HDF5 and boost are not installed where the build system can
automatically find it, type

$ export CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/the/include/directory"
$ export LDFLAGS"-L/path/to/the/libraries/directory"

For example, assuming that the libraries are installed in the directory
"local" in John's home directory, John should type:

$ export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/john/local/include"
$ export LDFLAGS="-L/home/john/local/lib"

and then

$ ./configure
$ ...
